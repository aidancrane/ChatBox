## Chat Box

This is a very light and small program that can be used to talk to people over a LAN network, or if a server is forwarded correctly, then it also can be used for chat globally, it is intended to be extremly light weight so uses strings.

## Side Note

We are currently moving from python sockets to a web-based UI and server. Therefore It is not currently functional.
